    "A variant of the shortest path problem involves a traveler planning a trip from city $s$ to city $t$. Here the vertices of the graph represent cities and the values in $d_{ij}$ represent distances. However, the traveler finds it difficult to leave each wonderful city he visits in his journey; so difficult that we multiply the $d_{ij}$ by 2 each time that he leaves a city. For instance, if $d_{01} = 5$, $d_{12} = 3$, and $d_{23} = 6$ then the $0$-$3$ path $0$-$1$-$2$-$3$ has score $5 + 2(3) + (2^2)6 = 35$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Make the correct modification and solve the problem for several randomly generated examples. Can you find an instance where the genetic algorithm's solution is better than the path proposed by NetworkX's `shortest_path` method (using the usual $d$ matrix for the distances), and the length of the path found is computed manually according to the new scoring rule for the above traveler?"
